Installation
============
1) Make sure that cURL PHP extension is enabled for your environment,
   because Driki relies on it to download the XML.

2) Place Driki in your modules directory.

3) Download Wiky.php: https://github.com/lahdekorpi/Wiky.php
   and put wiky.inc.php in sites/all/libraries/wiky/
   Driki relies on this class to support further parsing of
   Wiki syntax (e.g. lists). Afterwars clear the cache!

4) Add a field of the new type "Wiki entry" to your content type.

5) Create or edit a node. At the Driki widget you will see 2 form fields:
  - URL: holds the absolute path to your XML.
  - Filter Format: lists all available text formats of your Drupal installation.
    Choose a format whose filters should be applied to the imported data during
    rendering of the output.
    Note: If your selected text format has multiple different filters enabled,
    it would be best to make your Wiki syntax filter to be the first one that
    gets applied, otherwise results may be unexpected (especially when adding
    HTML like line break replacements etc.).
  - Once you save the node, Driki will download the XML and save it along with
    the URL and text format within the field database table.
  - View your node - The imported data should be parsed according to your
  	selected set of filters.

Note: Keep in mind that there are not many precautions of what Driki will save
		from the XML - so make sure that the field is only available to a selection
		of trusted users/roles.
